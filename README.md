## Guide description
This guide is designated to anybody with basic programming knowledge or a computer science background interested in NLP.

You can go Bottom-Up or Top-Down both works well and it is actually crucial to know which approach suites you the best. If you are okay with studying lots of mathematical concepts without application then use Bottom-Up. If you want to go hands-on first then use the Top-Down fist.

## Mathematical Foundations:
- Linear Algebra:
  This branch of Math is crucial for understanding the mechanism of Neural Networks which are the norm for NLP methodologies in nowadays State-of-The-Art.
